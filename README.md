# GIF Merger CLI Tool

Merge multiple GIF files into a single GIF, with options for orientation and lossy compression.

## Description

The GIF Merger CLI Tool allows users to merge multiple GIF files into a single GIF file. It supports both horizontal and vertical orientations for merging. Users can also choose to apply lossy compression to reduce the file size of the merged GIF, with a compression level adjustable from 0% (no compression) to 200% (maximum compression).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and use the GIF Merger CLI Tool on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- `pip` package manager to install Python dependencies.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gif-merger-cli-tool
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Tool

To run the GIF Merger CLI Tool, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python gif_merger.py
```

Follow the prompts to select GIF files, choose output options, and optionally apply compression.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic GIF Merging

Merge two GIF files (`file1.gif` and `file2.gif`) into a single GIF named `merged.gif` with vertical orientation and no compression.

1. Input:

   ```
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): file1.gif
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): file2.gif
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): done
   Enter path for the output merged GIF file (e.g., 'output.gif'): merged.gif
   Enter orientation ('horizontal' or 'vertical'): vertical
   Apply compression to the merged GIF? (yes/no): no
   ```

2. Output:
   - Merged GIF file `merged.gif` created in the current directory.

### Example 2: GIF Merging with Compression

Merge three GIF files (`gif1.gif`, `gif2.gif`, and `gif3.gif`) into a single GIF named `merged_compressed.gif` with horizontal orientation and 150% compression.

1. Input:

   ```
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): gif1.gif
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): gif2.gif
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): gif3.gif
   Enter path to GIF file (or 'done' to finish): done
   Enter path for the output merged GIF file (e.g., 'output.gif'): merged_compressed.gif
   Enter orientation ('horizontal' or 'vertical'): horizontal
   Apply compression to the merged GIF? (yes/no): yes
   Enter compression level (0-200, where 0 is no compression and 200 is maximum compression): 150
   ```

2. Output:
   - Merged GIF file `merged_compressed.gif` created with 150% compression applied.

## Running the Tests

Currently, the GIF Merger CLI Tool does not have automated tests. Manual testing is recommended by running the tool with various configurations and verifying the output GIF files.
